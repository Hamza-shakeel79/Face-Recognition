# Face-Recognition
A robust face recognition system using deep learning and OpenCV. This project detects and recognizes human faces in real-time using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), face embeddings, and similarity matching. Ideal for security, attendance systems, or any application requiring facial identity verification.
